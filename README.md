# 2021 Combined COMP1005/COMP1006/COMP1007 Programming Portfolio

## Introduction

This program will be a TCP/IP server that implements the version of Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the next hop across a network of networks.

The coursework is broken down into *three* parts. In the first part, a graph library using a linked lists as presented in COMP1005. In the second part, dijkstra’s algorithm as presented in COMP1006. In the third part, a TCP/IP server that is able to respond to queries about what the next-hop should be to access one network from another.
